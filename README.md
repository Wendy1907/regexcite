The goal of regexcite is to make regular expressions more exciting! It
provides convenience functions to make some common tasks with string
manipulation and regular expressions a bit easier.

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Wendy1907/regexcite")
```

## Usage

A fairly common task when dealing with strings is the need to split a
single string into many parts.

``` r
(x <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta")
#> [1] "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta"
strsplit(x, split = ",")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
stringr::str_split(x, pattern = ",")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
```

That’s exactly what `regexcite::str_split_one()` does.

``` r
library(regexcite)

str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
```

`str_split_one()` is built on `stringr::str_split()`, so you can use its
`n` argument and stringr’s interface for the `pattern`.

``` r
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",", n = 2)
#> [1] "alfa"                "bravo,charlie,delta"

y <- "192.168.0.1"
str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
#> [1] "192" "168" "0"   "1"
```
